    "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression technique used to deal with the problem of multicollinearity, which arises when two or more predictor variables in a model are highly correlated. Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the cost function of the regression model that shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, thereby reducing the impact of the correlated predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, ordinary least squares regression (OLS) does not account for multicollinearity and tries to fit a linear model that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted and observed values. OLS regression can lead to unstable and overfitting models when dealing with highly correlated predictors, whereas Ridge Regression can provide more robust and generalizable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty term in Ridge Regression is controlled by a tuning parameter, λ (lambda), which determines the degree of shrinkage applied to the regression coefficients. A larger value of λ leads to greater shrinkage and can help prevent overfitting. However, choosing an optimal value of λ can be challenging and requires cross-validation techniques."

In one-hot encoding, a binary variable is created for each category of the categorical variable, with a value of 1 if the observation belongs to that category, and 0 otherwise.\n",

    "For example, if we have a categorical variable \"Color\" with categories \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\", we can encode it using one-hot encoding as three binary variables: \"Color_Red\", \"Color_Green\", and \"Color_Blue\". An observation that belongs to the \"Red\" category would have a value of 1 for the \"Color_Red\" variable and 0 for the other two variables.\n",
